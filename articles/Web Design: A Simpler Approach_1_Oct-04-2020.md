# Web Design: A Simpler Approach

For some time now I have been meaning to re-design this site, and a recent lull in work as a result of COVID-19 has provided me the opportunity to do just that. 
With the `version 2` re-design, and the addition of the `Rambler` section, an article about the history of this site seems like a great first topic.


I initially developed this website between leaving graduate school and finding my first software development job.
It first project I had written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and a valuable learning tool for me prior to working professionaly on web projects.
[Version 1](https://github.com/kevingentile/kevingentile.com/releases/tag/v1.4.0) of this site leveraged a template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) from which I (exhaustively) generated a series of [component templates](https://github.com/kevingentile/kevingentile.com/tree/v1.4.0/templates) and drove the site from [compiled content](https://github.com/kevingentile/kevingentile.com/blob/v1.4.0/indexHandler.go#L21). Although, this would not be the approach I take today it worked for what I needed. This site has been running since 2017.

Using the site template from HTML5 UP has for years now felt like a cheat. Persionally, I find the styling aspect of web development to be monotonous. I have no problem taking care of business given a target design, but dedicating large chunks of my personal time to tinkering with HTML and CSS never felt condusive to my own professional development. Today, I still feel this way so I choose to take a very basic design approach using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/).

I look forward to improving upon the foundation I have laid out with this site. For now, I continue to dedicate part of my free time to mainaining the [GoVice project](https://github.com/govice) and related open-sourced projects.
